# AirportAssist
An android application to find your way through an airport (Dallas Love Field).
It works in conjunction with iBeacon sensor tags to give air travellers information about their 
flight status, terminal, gate number and other airport specific information based on the user’s location in the airport.

# MOTIVATION
	- Airport layouts are confusing.
	- Where am I ?  Where do I need to go ?
	- Could I grab some food on my way ?

We need a user friendly application that can answer the above with minimum manual user interventions.

# FEATURES
	- Alerts user’s current location on the map.
	- View departing flights
		- Flight number
		- Status
		- Departure Terminal/Gate
	- View nearby restaurants
